i still feel terrible right now as this is what happened on monday night but i needed some time to recover before sharing and have been sleeping since it happened     ;sadness
i mean that it feels to me that she feels that everyfuckingthing is my fault which fucking makes me irritated because im neither passive enough to tolerate it nor is it my fault    ;anger
i imagine they ll stay with me forever and i feel thrilled that i have a copy for my very own so that i can dip back into it whenever i wish;joy
i only have to think about a high school experience and i instantly feel like that shy confused and terrorised teenager again;fear
i part basically they are feeling sympathetic a bit to late in my opinion hachi rushes in to find that nobu is trying to help nana by blowing into a paper bag;love
